    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'merve';
    console.log(team2);
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    team4[3] = 'deniz';

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Merve Erdol',
        age: 29
    }

    // and think we make a copy:

    person.age = 55;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age:44, number: 58});
    console.log(captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const captain3 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
